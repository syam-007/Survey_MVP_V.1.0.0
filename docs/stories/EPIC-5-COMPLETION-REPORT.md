## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Framework:** Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with JSONField
- **Libraries:** welleng, numpy, openpyxl
- **Services:** DeltaCalculationService, ExcelExportService

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI:** Material-UI (MUI)
- **State:** React Query
- **Visualization:** Plotly.js
- **Routing:** React Router v6

### API Endpoints Defined
```
POST   /api/v1/survey-data/upload-reference/       - Upload reference
POST   /api/v1/comparisons/                         - Create comparison
GET    /api/v1/comparisons/{id}/                    - Get comparison
GET    /api/v1/comparisons/?run={run_id}            - List comparisons
GET    /api/v1/comparisons/{id}/export/             - Export comparison
DELETE /api/v1/comparisons/{id}/                    - Delete comparison
```

### Frontend Routes Defined
```
/runs/:runId/compare                                - Comparison page
```

### Database Models Defined
- `SurveyFile` (extended with survey_role)
- `ComparisonResult` (new)

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Delta Storage Format
**Decision:** Store deltas as JSON arrays in ComparisonResult model
**Rationale:**
- Flexible schema for variable-length delta arrays
- Efficient storage without additional tables
- Easy serialization for API responses
- PostgreSQL JSONField provides indexing and querying capabilities

### 2. Ratio Factor Application
**Decision:** Apply ratio factor only to visualization, not stored deltas
**Rationale:**
- Preserves original delta values for accuracy
- Allows dynamic ratio adjustment without recalculation
- Separates data storage from presentation

### 3. MD Alignment Strategy
**Decision:** Interpolate to common MD stations before delta calculation
**Rationale:**
- Ensures point-to-point comparison at same depths
- Handles surveys with different MD sampling
- Leverages existing interpolation service

### 4. Azimuth Wraparound Handling
**Decision:** Use formula `((delta + 180) % 360) - 180`
**Rationale:**
- Correctly handles 0°/360° boundary
- Returns delta in [-180°, 180°] range
- Industry-standard approach

### 5. State Management
**Decision:** Use React Query for comparison state
**Rationale:**
- Automatic caching of comparison results
- Background refetching and invalidation
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Reduces boilerplate compared to Redux
