# Story 1.3: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator
**I want** role-based access control for different user types
**so that** users have appropriate permissions based on their role

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User model extended with `role` field (Admin, Engineer, Viewer)
2. Permission decorators created for role-based access (`@require_role('admin')`)
3. Admin role: Full access to system management, users, and wells
4. Engineer/Surveyor role: Create runs, upload files, perform calculations
5. Viewer/Analyst role: Read-only access, download reports only
6. User management endpoints created (CRUD operations for admins only)
7. Frontend route guards implemented based on user roles
8. Unauthorized access returns 403 Forbidden with clear error message
9. Role switching tested in integration tests
10. Admin user seeded in database for initial access

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.2 Completion Notes]
- PostgreSQL migrations working successfully
- JWT authentication fully functional with token blacklist

- Material-UI forms working well with validation
- Testing strategy: Backend unit/integration tests with Django TestCase, 12/12 tests passing

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md, architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Custom User Model:**
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractUser
import uuid

class User(AbstractUser):
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
    role = models.CharField(
        max_length=20,
        choices=[
            ('Admin', 'Admin'),
            ('Engineer', 'Engineer'),
            ('Viewer', 'Viewer'),
        ],
        default='Viewer'
    )
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    def is_admin(self):
        return self.role == 'Admin'

    def is_engineer(self):
        return self.role in ['Admin', 'Engineer']

    def is_viewer(self):
        return self.role == 'Viewer'
```

**User Relationships:**
- User has many Runs (ForeignKey on Run model already exists per backend-architecture.md)
- User is referenced in authentication tokens

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Permission Classes Pattern:**
```python
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission

class IsAdmin(BasePermission):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        return request.user.is_authenticated and request.user.role == 'Admin'

class IsEngineerOrAdmin(BasePermission):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        return request.user.is_authenticated and request.user.role in ['Admin', 'Engineer']

class IsViewerOrAbove(BasePermission):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        if request.method in ['GET', 'HEAD', 'OPTIONS']:
            return request.user.is_authenticated
        return request.user.is_authenticated and request.user.role in ['Admin', 'Engineer']
```

**User Management Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/users` - List all users (Admin only)
- `GET /api/v1/users/{id}` - Get user details (Admin only)
- `PUT /api/v1/users/{id}` - Update user (Admin only)
- `DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}` - Delete user (Admin only)
- `PATCH /api/v1/users/{id}/role` - Update user role (Admin only)

**Error Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "You do not have permission to perform this action",
  "error_code": "PERMISSION_DENIED"
}
```

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**ProtectedRoute with Role Support:**
```typescript
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useAppSelector } from '../stores/hooks';

interface RoleProtectedRouteProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  requiredRole?: 'Admin' | 'Engineer' | 'Viewer';
}

export const RoleProtectedRoute: React.FC<RoleProtectedRouteProps> = ({
  children,
  requiredRole
}) => {
  const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAppSelector((state) => state.auth);

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <Navigate to="/login" replace />;
  }

  if (requiredRole) {
    if (requiredRole === 'Admin' && user?.role !== 'Admin') {
      return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" replace />;
    }
    if (requiredRole === 'Engineer' && !['Admin', 'Engineer'].includes(user?.role || '')) {
      return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" replace />;
    }
  }

  return <>{children}</>;
};
```

**Auth Types Update:**
```typescript
export interface User {
  id: number;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  role: 'Admin' | 'Engineer' | 'Viewer';  // NEW FIELD
  date_joined: string;
}
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Backend Tests:**
- Use Django TestCase for integration tests
- Test file: `apps/api/tests/test_rbac.py`
- Required test scenarios:
  - Admin can access all endpoints (users CRUD, runs CRUD)
  - Engineer can create/update runs but cannot access user management
  - Viewer can only read data, cannot create/update/delete
  - 403 Forbidden returned for insufficient permissions
  - Role changes immediately affect permissions
  - Admin user seeding command works correctly

**Test Pattern:**
```python
class RBACTestCase(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.client = APIClient()
        self.admin = User.objects.create_user(
            username='admin', password='pass', role='Admin'
        )
        self.engineer = User.objects.create_user(
            username='engineer', password='pass', role='Engineer'
        )
        self.viewer = User.objects.create_user(
            username='viewer', password='pass', role='Viewer'
        )

    def test_admin_can_manage_users(self):
        self.client.force_authenticate(user=self.admin)
        response = self.client.get('/api/v1/users')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)

    def test_engineer_cannot_manage_users(self):
        self.client.force_authenticate(user=self.engineer)
        response = self.client.get('/api/v1/users')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN)
```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Python 3.11+ required for backend
- Django 5.2+ with Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL 15+ database
- TypeScript 5.3+ for frontend type safety
- React 18.2+ with hooks
- Redux Toolkit 1.9+ for state management

**Security Requirements:**
- Never allow role escalation through API
- Admin role cannot be assigned during registration (only through admin interface or seeding)
- All permission checks must be server-side (client-side is for UX only)
- Audit log user role changes (future enhancement - not in this story)

### Project Structure Notes
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

All files align with the defined monorepo structure:
- Backend models in `apps/api/survey_api/models/`
- Backend views in `apps/api/survey_api/views/`
- Backend permissions in `apps/api/survey_api/permissions/`
- Frontend components in `apps/web/src/components/`
- Frontend pages in `apps/web/src/pages/`
- Tests in `apps/api/tests/` and `apps/web/tests/`

### Role Permission Matrix

| Action | Admin | Engineer | Viewer |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| View all users | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Create/Edit/Delete users | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Create runs | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Upload survey files | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Perform calculations | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View runs/files | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Download reports | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Modify system settings | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Testing

### Test File Location
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Backend: `apps/api/tests/test_rbac.py`
- Frontend (optional): `apps/web/tests/components/RoleProtectedRoute.test.tsx`

### Test Standards
- Use Django TestCase for backend integration tests
- Create separate test users for each role (Admin, Engineer, Viewer)
- Test both positive (allowed) and negative (forbidden) scenarios
- Verify 403 status code for unauthorized access
- Test all user management endpoints with different roles
- Verify admin seeding command creates admin with correct role

### Testing Frameworks
- Backend: Django TestCase, DRF APIClient
- Commands: Django TestCase with call_command
- All tests must pass before marking story complete

### Specific Testing Requirements
1. Create 3 test users (one for each role)
2. Test all 4 user management endpoints (list, get, update, delete) with each role
3. Verify only Admin can access user management
4. Test that role field is included in auth responses (/api/v1/auth/me, /api/v1/auth/login)
5. Test admin seeding command (idempotent - should not fail if admin exists)
6. Minimum 15 test cases expected for comprehensive coverage

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** HIGH
**Risk Category:** Security & Access Control
**Justification:**
- Implements role-based access control affecting authentication and authorization
- Changes to user model require database migration
- Security-critical feature that controls access to sensitive operations
- Self-protection mechanisms prevent privilege escalation
- Impacts all future features requiring role-based permissions

**Mitigation Measures:**
- Comprehensive test suite (16/16 tests passing)
- Server-side permission enforcement (not relying on client-side checks)
- Self-protection logic prevents admin self-demotion/deletion
- Clear error messages for unauthorized access (403 Forbidden)
- Idempotent admin seeding command for reliable setup

### Code Quality Review

**Overall Grade:** A

**Strengths:**
1. **Security Best Practices:**
   - Self-protection logic prevents admin from demoting/deleting self
   - Server-side permission enforcement with DRF permission classes
   - Password validation and hashing handled correctly
   - UUID primary keys for users (better security than sequential integers)

2. **Code Organization:**
   - Clear separation of concerns (models, views, permissions, serializers)
   - Well-documented with docstrings on all classes and methods
   - Consistent error response format across all endpoints
   - Helper methods on User model (is_admin, is_engineer, is_viewer, can_manage_users, can_create_runs)

3. **Robustness:**
   - Comprehensive error handling (User.DoesNotExist, validation errors)
   - Idempotent admin seeding command
   - Role validation in serializer
   - Frontend type safety with TypeScript UserRole type

4. **Testing:**
   - 16 comprehensive integration tests covering all scenarios
   - Tests include positive and negative cases
   - Edge cases tested (self-demotion, self-deletion)
   - Management command tested for idempotency

**Minor Observations:**
1. Frontend RoleProtectedRoute has special logic for Engineer role (lines 44-46) that assumes hierarchical permissions. This works but could be refactored to use a role hierarchy lookup.
2. UserManagementSerializer duplicates role validation that's already in the model. This is acceptable for explicit validation but could be DRY.
3. No audit logging for role changes (noted as "future enhancement" in story, so acceptable for this iteration).

**Code Style:** Consistent with Django/DRF best practices, follows PEP 8, good TypeScript conventions.

---

### Security Review

**Security Assessment:** PASS

**Security Features Implemented:**
1. ✅ Server-side permission enforcement (not relying on client-side)
2. ✅ Self-protection: Admin cannot demote self (`user_views.py:68-74`)
3. ✅ Self-protection: Admin cannot delete self (`user_views.py:113-118`)
4. ✅ Default role is Viewer (least privilege principle)
5. ✅ Role validation in serializer prevents invalid roles
6. ✅ Authentication required for all role-protected endpoints
7. ✅ Clear 403 Forbidden responses with error codes
8. ✅ Password not exposed in UserSerializer or UserManagementSerializer

**Security Considerations:**
- ✅ No role escalation possible through registration endpoint (default is Viewer)
- ✅ Only Admin can change roles via PATCH `/api/v1/users/{id}/update`
- ✅ Frontend route guards provide UX, but security enforced server-side
- ✅ UUID primary keys prevent user enumeration attacks
- ⚠️ Admin seeding uses environment variables (good), but default password "admin123" should be changed immediately (warning message included)

**Recommendation:** PASS with note to change default admin password after first login (warning already in place).

---

### Performance Review

**Performance Assessment:** PASS

**Performance Considerations:**
1. ✅ Database queries optimized with `.order_by('-created_at')` for user list
2. ✅ Role checks use in-memory operations (is_admin, is_engineer methods)
3. ✅ No N+1 query issues in user management endpoints
4. ✅ Tests run in acceptable time (59.402s for 16 tests including DB setup)
5. ✅ UUID indexing on User.id provides good query performance

**Test Performance:**
- 16 tests executed in 59.402s (avg ~3.7s per test including setup/teardown)
- Test database creation and destruction efficient
- No performance bottlenecks detected
