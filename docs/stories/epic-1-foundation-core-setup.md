# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Setup

## Epic Goal
Establish the foundational infrastructure for the Survey Management System, including project scaffolding, authentication system, and database schema. This epic creates the base upon which all other features will be built.

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - Must be completed first before any other epics

## User Value
As a development team, we need a solid foundation with proper project structure, authentication, and data models so that we can efficiently build survey management features on a stable, secure platform.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Monorepo structure established with working frontend and backend
- [x] Local development environment fully functional (Docker Compose)
- [x] Authentication system operational with JWT tokens
- [x] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implemented for all three user roles
- [x] Database schema created and migrations applied successfully
- [x] All core models defined and tested
- [x] Developer can run the full stack locally without errors

## Stories

### Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Monorepo Setup
**As a** developer
**I want** a properly configured monorepo with frontend and backend projects
**so that** I can start implementing features in a well-organized codebase

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Monorepo structure created following source-tree.md with `apps/web/` and `apps/api/`
2. npm workspaces configured in root `package.json`
3. React frontend initialized with TypeScript, Vite, and Material-UI
4. Django backend initialized with virtual environment and Django REST Framework
5. PostgreSQL database configured and accessible
6. Redis configured for caching and sessions
7. Docker Compose file created for local development with all services
8. `.env.example` created with all required environment variables
9. README.md with quickstart instructions for local development
10. All services start successfully with `docker-compose up`

**Story Points:** 8

### Story 1.2: Authentication System Implementation
**As a** system administrator
**I want** a secure authentication system with JWT tokens
**so that** users can securely log in and access the system based on their roles

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Django authentication system configured with JWT token support
2. User registration endpoint implemented (`POST /api/v1/auth/register`)
3. User login endpoint implemented (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`) returning JWT tokens
4. Token refresh endpoint implemented (`POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`)
5. Token validation middleware created for protected routes
6. Password hashing using Django's secure methods
7. Token expiration and refresh policies configured (30 min access, 7 day refresh)
8. Frontend authentication service created with token storage
9. Frontend login/logout flows implemented
10. All authentication endpoints tested with unit and integration tests

**Story Points:** 13

### Story 1.3: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**As a** system administrator
**I want** role-based access control for different user types
**so that** users have appropriate permissions based on their role

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User model extended with `role` field (Admin, Engineer, Viewer)
2. Permission decorators created for role-based access (`@require_role('admin')`)
3. Admin role: Full access to system management, users, and wells
4. Engineer/Surveyor role: Create runs, upload files, perform calculations
5. Viewer/Analyst role: Read-only access, download reports only
6. User management endpoints created (CRUD operations for admins only)
7. Frontend route guards implemented based on user roles
8. Unauthorized access returns 403 Forbidden with clear error message
9. Role switching tested in integration tests
10. Admin user seeded in database for initial access

**Story Points:** 8

---

### Story 1.4: Database Schema & Core Models
**As a** developer
**I want** all core database models defined and migrated
**so that** I can build features on a stable data foundation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Well model created with fields: id (UUID), well_name, well_type, timestamps
2. Run model created with all fields per database-schema.md (run_number, run_name, run_type, bhc_enabled, etc.)
3. Location model created with lat/long, UTM coordinates, geodetic system, etc.
4. Depth model created with elevation reference, datum, heights
5. SurveyFile model created for uploaded file tracking
6. SurveyCalculation model created for calculation results storage
7. All models have proper relationships (ForeignKeys, CASCADE deletes)
8. Database indexes created per database-schema.md for performance
9. Django migrations generated and applied successfully
10. Model unit tests written and passing (creation, validation, relationships)
11. Database can be reset and reseeded with `manage.py migrate --run-syncdb`

**Story Points:** 13
