# Non-Functional Requirements

* Performance: Calculations should complete within a few seconds for typical datasets (<10,000 records).
* Scalability: Must handle large surveys with tens of thousands of data points.
* Usability: The application supports a structured workflow, but it is not strictly linear. Users can move between sections as needed, either following the recommended order or jumping directly to specific sections.
* Data Validation: Clear error messages if input files are invalid or missing columns.
* Portability: Should run in modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
