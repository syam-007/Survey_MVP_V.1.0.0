summary: |
  Story 2.4 delivers a comprehensive run management frontend with RTK Query integration,
  Material-UI v7 components, and a robust three-tier test architecture (44 unit, 58 integration,
  21 E2E). The implementation meets all 12 acceptance criteria with solid code quality and
  excellent requirements traceability. However, three critical concerns prevent a PASS:
  1) Tests written but never executed - no evidence of passing test runs
  2) Authentication bypass makes all users admin-equivalent (security concern)
  3) MUI v7 Grid API compatibility required significant refactoring

  The code quality is high, architecture is sound, and test coverage is comprehensive.
  After running the test suite and verifying test results, this would be a strong PASS.

riskAssessment:
  riskLevel: "HIGH"
  riskSignals:
    - "Authentication/security changes (permissions.py, RoleProtectedRoute.tsx)"
    - "100+ tests added across three test levels"
    - "Large diff: 23 new files created, 4 modified"
    - "12 acceptance criteria (>5 threshold triggers deep review)"

  mitigations:
    - "Comprehensive test suite with 123 test cases"
    - "Three-tier testing: unit, integration, E2E"
    - "Known limitations clearly documented in story"

    - "Mock data incomplete (Run type missing location/depth)"

  recommendation: |
    Tests were written without ever being run. This is a CRITICAL quality issue.
    All 4 test files have TypeScript compilation errors that would have been caught
    immediately on first test execution. Development workflow did not include running
    tests during implementation.

reviewNotes: |
  This is a solid implementation of the run management frontend. The code quality is high,
  the architecture follows React/Redux best practices, and the test suite is comprehensive
  with excellent coverage across three test levels (unit, integration, E2E).

  The major concern is that tests were written but never run. Without test execution logs,
  we cannot verify the implementation is correct. This is a CRITICAL blocker that MUST be
  resolved before marking the story Done.

  The authentication bypass (all users get full CRUD access) is a security concern but may
  be acceptable for MVP if properly documented. A follow-up story should implement proper
  role-based access control.

  The MUI v7 Grid API compatibility issue was handled well by the dev agent, but indicates
  potential dependency management issues. Consider pinning major dependency versions.

  After running the test suite and verifying results, this implementation would be a strong
  PASS. The code is well-structured, maintainable, and demonstrates good engineering practices.
