# Quality Score (0-100)
quality_score: 93

# Overall Assessment
assessment: |
  Story 1.1 implementation is comprehensive and high quality. The monorepo structure has been
  successfully created with proper workspaces, frontend and backend properly configured, and both
  services running successfully. All infrastructure files (Docker Compose, .env.example, README)
  are in place and well-documented. Both frontend (React+Vite) and backend (Django+DRF) servers
  are operational and accessible. Minor deductions for missing Docker Compose full stack testing
  (requires Docker Desktop) and a resolved frontend icon dependency issue.

# Gate Decision
gate_decision:
  status: "PASS"
  confidence: "HIGH"

  rationale: |
    Story 1.1 implementation meets all 10 acceptance criteria with high quality:

    ✅ Monorepo structure properly organized with apps/ and packages/
    ✅ npm workspaces configured for code sharing
    ✅ React frontend with TypeScript, Vite, Material-UI, Redux Toolkit
    ✅ Django backend with DRF, JWT, proper settings structure
    ✅ PostgreSQL configured and migrations working
    ✅ Redis configured for caching and sessions
    ✅ Docker Compose file with all 4 services configured
    ✅ .env.example with all required variables documented
    ✅ Comprehensive README with quickstart guide
    ✅ Both services running and accessible

    The implementation provides a solid foundation for development with excellent developer
    experience (hot reload, fast builds, clear documentation). Docker Compose configuration
    is complete and ready for testing when Docker Desktop is available. All individual
    services verified working correctly.

  recommendations:
    - "Proceed to next stories - foundation is solid"
    - "Test Docker Compose when Docker Desktop available (optional verification)"
    - "Consider adding Docker health checks in future iteration"
    - "Consider adding pre-commit hooks for code quality (future enhancement)"
